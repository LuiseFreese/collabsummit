# Collabsummit

This file shall give you some local information on how things are currently going regarding Covid19 situation in Duesseldorf, where Collabsummit takes place. I happen to live here and I am of course observing the situation and got asked by so many friends and colleagues that I decided to write down the information I have. Please make sure you understand that by no means I am an _official source_ or that I would represent the conference Collabsummit. I just want to give some more friends and friends to be a more local insight, as I know that reading news can be confusing. I will try to link to official resources. 

In Germany, we have 16 different states, Collabsummit takes place in Duesseldorf, which is the capital of the state North-Rhine Westphalia. 

## Entry to Germany

- If you want to enter Germany, please check https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/coronavirus/2317268
- If you visited a high risk area or an area of variant of concern in the last 10 days you must register at https://www.einreiseanmeldung.de
- You can look up if your country is on that list here: [Risk area information by RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Transport/Archiv_Risikogebiete/Risikogebiete_aktuell_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)

In case your country is on that list, please be aware, its important that you determine if your country is a either high risk area or an area of variant of concern, as differnt rules apply. If 

- your country is "only" a high risk area,
- you are fully vaccinated OR recovered

I highlighted a very important part of  here: [Risk area information by RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Transport/Archiv_Risikogebiete/Risikogebiete_aktuell_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)

## Rules in North Rhine Westphalia

You will come across terms like `3G`, `2G` and `2Gplus`/ `2G+` - I will explain what they mean: 

- `3G` means you need to bei either fully vaccinated or recovered or present a negative test
- `2G` means that you need to be either fully vaccinated or recovered. People who are not fully vaccinated or recovered can not present a negative test in replacement.
- `2Gplus`/`2G+` means that in addition to bei either fully vaccinated or recovered you need to present a negative test. 

Nearly everywhere indoor masks (medical, FFP2 or N95) are required. 

If `3G`, `2G` or `2Gplus`/`2G+` applies, depends on the 7-Day-hospitalization rate in the state. The single source of truth to publish these numbers is the Robert-Koch Institut. They publish monday-friday:

- in english as apage here: [Covid19 Situation Report](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/infections/epidemiology/outbreaks/COVID-19/Situationsberichte_Tab.html)
- in german as a dashboard here: [Covid19 Trends](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/COVID-19-Trends/COVID-19-Trends.html?__blob=publicationFile#/home)

As I know that it is a little bit hard to read if you don't speak german, I highlighted how you find the important value:

Now today (Nov 22) this value is at 3,92. 

If this value is 

- above 3, but below 6, then `2G` applies, which means that you need to be either fully vaccinated or recovered. People who are not fully vaccinated or recovered can not present a negative test in replacement.
- above 6, but below 9 means that `2Gplus`/`2G+` applies, which means, that in addition to bei either fully vaccinated or recovered you need to present a negative test. 
- above 9 means, that North Rhine Westphalia can take further measures like canceling big events or lockdowns
